        <strong>What is Open Meditations?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a podcast of 10-minute guided meditations</li>
        <li>free to use, and free of ads and intros</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How do I start?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Try to find a place that you can sit with your eyes closed for the
          duration of the recording.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to sit with an upright, but relaxed spine. (imagine a string
          pulling the crown of the head, then let the string go slack and feel
          the spine stacking comfortably)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Why breath?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We‚Äôll usually use breath as the object of meditation, simply because
          it‚Äôs readily available to almost everyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being conscious of your breath is a useful skill outside of formal
          meditation. Noticing your breath throughout the day can help you get a
          sense of your mood (Are you breathing deep or shallow? Are you holding
          your breath? When you breathe, where does it move in the body?)
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on their personal history, it‚Äôs possible that breath and
          body-focused meditations aren‚Äôt right for everyone. You can contact me
          at derick [at] openmeditations [dot] org with any questions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>What ‚Äútradition‚Äù does it belong to?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          These meditations are not affiliated with an organization or group,
          nor are they specific to any one tradition.
        </li>
        <li>
          They‚Äôre a version of what comes when I lead meditations in person.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a look at the additional resources below to see some of the
          influences for Open Meditations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>More tips:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have an <strong>issue closing your eyes</strong>, you can let
          them close half way, letting your unfocused gaze stay on a single
          point in front of you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Try not to force or control the breath</strong>. Instead, let
          it lead the body and mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you find your mind to be{" "}
          <strong>especially tired or restless</strong>, unable to focus on the
          meditation itself, you can take 3 deep breaths ‚Äî active inhale and
          complete exhale ‚Äî as the full-body feeling of a deep breath can help
          ground you in your present experience
        </li>
        <li>
          If you come to the end of a meditation and realize you were thinking
          the entire time, that‚Äôs fine! Note the places your mind went. Don‚Äôt
          worry about whether a particular meditation ‚Äúcounts‚Äù or not.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you‚Äôre able to (and feel the desire to),{" "}
          <strong>you might sit for a few more minutes in silence</strong>,
          following the breath and sensations in the body. Think of it like the
          savasana at the end of yoga class.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask yourself</strong> ‚Äúhow is my breathing right now?‚Äù a few
          times a day.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>One way to start a daily practice:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One goal for any habit is to get to the point where it feels easier to
          keep doing than to stop doing (even if it‚Äôs sometimes difficult in the
          moment)
        </li>
        <li>Choose a specific time (right when you wake up works well)</li>
        <li>Commit to practicing every day for 20 days (even weekends!)</li>
        <li>See how you feel on day 20.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How did this podcast start?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At work in SF: I was doing yoga teacher training at the{" "}
          <a href="http://yogasocietysanfrancisco.com/">
            Yoga Society of San Francisco
          </a>{" "}
          while also working at a startup in the city. I taught hatha yoga in
          the mornings and spent my days at the office. I started leading short
          breathing exercises to my co-workers before and after company
          workouts.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          At work in NYC: A colleague and I started a daily meditation group in
          the office. Sometimes I would lead. Other times members of the group
          shared recordings they had found. We had a few that we liked, some
          free, some paid apps. When people with paid subscriptions missed,
          we&#39;d search our phones for alternatives. Eventually we settled on
          one or two free recordings that we all liked well enough. But it was
          difficult to balance variety with convenience while keeping things
          simple and accessible. I started leading more often. Someone suggested
          I start recording. These recordings were the beginning of this
          podcast.
