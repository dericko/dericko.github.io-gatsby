      <p>What is Open Meditations?**</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a podcast of 10-minute guided meditations led by Derick Olson</li>
        <li>started among friends and coworkers</li>
        <li>free to use, and free of ads and intros</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>How do I start?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Try to find a place that you can sit with your eyes closed for the
          duration of the recording.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to sit with an upright, but relaxed spine. (Imagine a string
          pulling through the crown of the head, then let the string go slack
          and the spine stack comfortable)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>One way to start a daily practice:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One goal for any habit is to get to the point where feels easier to
          keep doing than to stop doing (even if it‚Äôs sometimes difficult in the
          moment)
        </li>
        <li>Choose a specific time (right when you wake up works well)</li>
        <li>Commit to practicing every day for 20 days (even weekends!)</li>
        <li>See how you feel on day 20</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>More tips:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have an <strong>issue closing your eyes</strong>, you can let
          them close half way, letting your unfocused gaze stay on a single
          point in front of you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Try not to force or control the breath</strong>. Instead, let
          it lead the body and mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you find your mind to be{" "}
          <strong>especially tired or restless</strong>, unable to focus on the
          meditation itself, you can take 3 deep breaths ‚Äî active inhale and
          complete exhale ‚Äî as the full-body feeling of a deep breath can help
          ground you in your present experience
        </li>
        <li>
          If you come to the end of a meditation and realize you were thinking
          the entire time, that‚Äôs fine! Note the places your mind went. Don‚Äôt
          worry about whether a particular meditation ‚Äúcounts‚Äù or not.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you‚Äôre able to (and feel the desire to),{" "}
          <strong>you might sit for a few more minutes in silence</strong>,
          following the breath and sensations in the body. Think of it like the
          savasana at the end of yoga class.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask yourself</strong> ‚Äúhow is my breathing?‚Äù a few times a
          day.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Why breath?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We‚Äôll usually use breath as the object of meditation, simply because
          it‚Äôs readily available to almost everyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being conscious of your breath is a useful skill outside of formal
          meditation. Noticing your breath throughout the day can help you get a
          sense of your mood (Are you breathing deep or shallow? Are you holding
          your breath? When you breathe, where does it move in the body?)
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on their personal history, it‚Äôs possible that breath and
          body-focused meditations aren‚Äôt right for everyone. You can contact me
          with any questions.

        <strong>How did it start?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At work in SF: I was doing yoga teacher training in San Francisco at
          YSSF while also working at a startup in the city. I taught hatha yoga
          in the mornings then spent my day at the office. After bi-weekly
          company workouts I started leading short breathing exercises.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          At work in NYC: A colleague and I started a daily meditation group in
          the office. Members of the group took turns sharing recordings they
          had found. Sometimes I would lead. We had a few that we liked, some
          free, some paid for through an app. Sometimes the people with the
          subscriptions missed, so we‚Äôd search our phones for something else.
          Eventually we settle on one or two free recordings that we liked well
          enough. It was difficult to balance variety with convenience while
          keeping things simple and accessible. I started leading more often.
          Someone suggested I record them. These recordings are the beginning of
          this podcast.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>What ‚Äútradition‚Äù does it belong to?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          These meditations are not affiliated with an organization or group,
          nor are they specific to any one tradition.
        </li>
        <li>
          They‚Äôre a version of what comes when I lead meditations in person.
